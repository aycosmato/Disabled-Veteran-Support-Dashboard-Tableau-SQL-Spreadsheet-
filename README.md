# Disabled-Veteran-Support-Analytics: A Data-Driven Look at VA Compensation and Population Trends
This project integrates public datasets from the VA Open Data portal and the U.S. Census Bureau to analyze trends in the disabled veteran population, compensation rates, and future projections. The goal is to understand the implications of veteran support needs on federal budgets and regional disparities during a period of fiscal constraint.

## Goal
To explore the growth of the disabled veteran population and its financial impact on government budgetsâ€”highlighting the regional and demographic trends shaping future support service needs.

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel** â€“ Data cleaning, reshaping, and formatting
- **SQLite (via DB Browser)** â€“ Relational database schema, SQL-based analysis
- **Tableau** â€“ Visual dashboard creation and interactive storytelling

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and normalization (Excel, Power Query)
- Relational database schema design and SQL table creation
- Complex SQL queries for EDA and KPI extraction
- Joining multi-source datasets by FIPS codes and keys
- Data visualization and dashboard development in Tableau

## Key Outcomes
- Identified a 7% increase in disability recipients between 2021â€“2023
- Mapped disparities in compensation and population support by state and region
- Projected veteran population trends by age and gender through 2053
- Created interactive dashboards for policymakers and advocates
